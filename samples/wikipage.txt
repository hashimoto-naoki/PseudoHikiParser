!Welcome to the PseudoHikiParser wiki!

!! About PseudoHikiParser

PseudoHikiParser is a converter of texts written in a [[Hiki|http://hikiwiki.org/en/]] like notation, into html or other formats. 

Currently, only a limited range of notations can be converted into HTML4 or XHTML1.0.

I am writing this tool with following objectives in mind,

* provide some additional features that doesn't exist in the original Hiki
** make the notation more line oriented
** allow to assign ids to elements such as headings
* support several formats other than HTML
** The visitor pattern is adopted for the implementation, so you only have to add a visitor class to support a certain format.

And, it would not be compatible with the original Hiki notation.

!! License

I haven't yet decided the terms and conditions for the reuse and redistribution, but consider adopting a dual-licensed style. 

And one of them will be BSD 2-clause license or MIT license.

!! Additional Features

!!! Already Implemented

!!!! Assigning ids

If you add [name_of_id], just after the marks that denote heading or list type items, it becomes the id attribute of resulting html elements. Below is an example.

<<<
!![heading_id]heading

*[list_id]list
>>>

will be rendered as


 <div class="section h2">
 <h2 id="HEADING_ID">heading
 </h2>
 <ul>
 <li id="LIST_ID">list
 </li>
 </ul>
 <!-- end of section h2 -->
 </div>


!!! Not Implemented Yet
